  <p> &emsp;  Sentience is beneficial because it will allow humans to get into branches of life they otherwise would not be able to. AI can open many doors that will enhance and enrich the world and the human race.Ai is getting better exponentially, and soon it will lead to a utopia for humans. 10 years ago it would be a miracle to make AI talk back but now with new technology, it is possible to live in a world where AIs can be doing most of the work. Ai sentience engineer Mr.Clerk said, “You used to look at A.I.-generated language and say, ‘Wow, it kind of wrote a sentence”. “And now you’re looking at stuff that’s A.I.-generated and saying, ‘This is really funny, I’m enjoying reading this,’ or ‘I had no idea this was even generated by A.I.’” If Ai’s are a success then we are looking at a world where AIs can do all the hard work and human beings will just do the creative things they want to do. AI’s will be doing everything from labor-intensive jobs like cleaning houses schools and buildings to packing and shipping items. Ai’s have already advanced the world a lot since they get used to manufacturing products. Ai’s working a human's job is not as much of a fantasy as it used to be. Japan has already made robots that can take orders without assistance and transfer food to tables efficiently. What's exciting is that the robots are controlled by disabled people which means even disabled people can work and contribute to society like they never did. The Ai’s help the workers prepare food more efficiently instead of paying other people to be waiters. In the future when sentient Ai will be more upgraded, we might even be able to have debates with Ai’s and them have their own opinion on things. R.Goertzel robot Desdemona which is the world’s first Ai robot frontwomen played the New York Times gig in front of thousands of people which shocked the world and showed how much Ai’s have improved and how close we are to having true sentient Ai. But sentient Ai still has a long way to go until they can be truly Sentience. Critics like the chief executive and chief scientist of SingularityNET Dr.Goertzel think that Ai’s are still not sentient and the people them to be sentient are by saying “The problem is that people closest to the technology- the people explaining it to the public- live with one foot in the future. They sometimes see what they believe will happen as much as they see what is happening now” . Professor of psychology Alison Gopnik also agrees with Goertzel saying “ the computational capacity of current A. I like the large language models don't make it any more likely that they are sentient than that rock or other machines are”. Even though critics think that Ai still cannot be called sentience, there is no reason why it won't be in the future. When sentient Ai’s will be the norm, humans will be able to do the things that they wanted to and will have a lot more time than they previously used to because of not needing to do the jobs they used to which will cause utopia for humans.<br></p>
