   <p> I like the topic of the automated garden and even making robots work to improve plant growth. It can also help us fix world hunger if we find an efficient way to produce food through plants, but I feel like it is way too much of a jump.  Since plants are susceptible and need specific requirements to flourish, I do not think making Ai work on them will improve the situation, so I reject this plan.

    <p> DX3 sounds like a nice idea to implement because of its ability to improve concentration but I reject this plan because it is a huge invasion of privacy for a camera to detect facial expressions and most people will not be accepting to the idea.</p>

    <p>The Cafe project is to make food delivery more efficient. The problem with it is that it is way too inefficient for companies to go to the desired location of purchasers to give them their food. That is not only inefficient but time-consuming and costly. It also puts employees at risk of getting attacked</p>

    <p>I like the idea of Smartshop and being able to purchase specific clothes but unfortunately, the market for that already exists and the competition would be high.</p>

    <p>I like the creative thinking in the making of Tempora but it doesn't seem so compete with existing games out there that have similar ideas. Also, I donâ€™t know how time has to do anything with saving the world or letting it burn.
