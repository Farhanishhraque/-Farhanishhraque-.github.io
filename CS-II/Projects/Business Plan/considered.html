   <p> I like the topic of the automated garden and even making robots work to improve plant growth. It can also help us fix world hunger if we find an efficient way to produce food through plants, but I feel like it is way too much of a jump.  Since plants are susceptible and need specific requirements to flourish, I do not think making Ai work on them will improve the situation, so I reject this plan.

    <p> DX3 sounds like a nice idea to implement because of its ability to improve concentration but I reject this plan because it is a huge invasion of privacy for a camera to detect facial expressions and most people will not be accepting to the idea.</p>

    <p>The Cafe project is to make food delivery more efficient. The problem with it is that it is way too inefficient for companies to go to the desired location of purchasers to give them their food. That is not only inefficient but time-consuming and costly. It also puts employees at risk of getting attacked</p>

    <p>I like the idea of Smartshop and being able to purchase specific clothes but unfortunately, the market for that already exists and the competition would be high.</p>

    <p>I like the creative thinking in the making of Tempora but it doesn't seem so compete with existing games out there that have similar ideas. Also, I don’t know how time has to do anything with saving the world or letting it burn.

    <p>Having an app that personalizes schedule depending on a student's needs seems too specific in its function and doest allow other people to use it making it have lesser downloads overall which makes it harder to work with on top of it competing with other apps that allow people to personalize their schedule.</p>

    <p>The attendance app even though I like creative thinking and trying to solve a problem but isn't really effective because most students will probably cheat the system by turning in their attendance themselves. It also is a huge issue of teachers calling attendance anyways.

    <p>  I can definitely see how the idea of a 2d game can capture people's attention because most of us have played some sort of mobile game that was a 2d game. But the competition is just way too much considering there are games such as temple run and sonic which are huge hits.

    <p> I like the concept this plan is trying to achieve which is to improve the cs students’ knowledge of computer science through networking with different teachers. That is a really good idea but I am not necessarily interested in being a part of this so I reject this plan. Also, there are already apps that do this which is skillshare or zoom.

    <p> I really like the idea of mini therapy since most people nowadays need a break from their life and really ask themselves if they are happy with life and what they can do to improve their life whether it is their physical or mental state. Corona has also really impacte people's lives recently and I think a lot of people still need to recover from it. This project targets just that and I am willing to work on this project because I want to help people with their physical and mental being.</p>
