   <p> I like the topic of the automated garden and even making robots work to improve plant growth. It can also help us fix world hunger if we find an efficient way to produce food through plants, but I feel like it is way too much of a jump.  Since plants are susceptible and need specific requirements to flourish, I do not think making Ai work on them will improve the situation, so I reject this plan.
