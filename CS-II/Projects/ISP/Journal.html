      For this week the technical challenges we faced were committing things that were in the repository to Git Hub. Because of this, we were having trouble uploading our readme.md file in the GitHub repository. We later fixed this by going to the shell and first making a repository for our project and then to the repository making a readme file and pushing it to github through git push. We also had problems like not being able to work on the same code but we fixed those issues by doing get clone so that all of us can work on the same code and edit the way we want to .<br><br>

      For this week our main scheduling challenge was coming together and making a good website that can run. We first cloned all of our repositories so we could work on the same code and then created the basic functionality of the website since our teacher said that we would rather first make the website so it is functional and then add the advanced stuff to it.<br><br>

      We were having some challenges because one of our team member was not able to get the GitHub repository for our project since he had a miscommunication with the teacher and he could not get the link to accept the invite from the teacher. Even though there was a problem he eventually fixed it by telling the teacher about it and later getting the invitation link.<br><br>

	Technical challenges :Technical challenges: The first challenge since we started the project in 2022 was that our team was trying to come up with an idea that would be beneficial to use as a project both for the class and for ourselves. We were trying to basically go by the term “two birds in one storm” and make something that will give us a good grade and also serve as a great achievement to show to job recruiters. So in order to tackle this we decided to do a Project which lets people get some mental health support through a mini-therapy session. This not only meets all the requirements for our project for the class but also is a good resource to use because of all that we have gone through since 2020 with the covid and everything that has happened since then.
	<br>
	<br>
	Scheduling Challenges: So far our first challenge was to create a schedule and how we will use our time to make paste M possession and finish the project in time. Since we learned that our project has to be done by the end of this year we took note of how many months we have and started dividing each section up into 50 pieces. For now, we have decided that we wheel work to build a site that is completely functional and has no problems navigating. In order to complete this challenge we have watched videos on YouTube and have read some articles online on how to make a page that is precisely navigable add has all the features for a popular-looking page or page that people will click on. We have already begun working on it text you are confident that we will be able to finish in time according to our deadlines.
	<br>
	<br>
	Interpersonal challenges: So far to be honest Sense we just started the project about a month ago and all of us have a basic background in computer science and have taken columns by one together in the same school, we all pretty much basically have the same bag on Amazon cam site so there haven't been too many challenges where one person we're not understanding something so far. we also didn't have any communication errors so far so we look forward to keeping this up but this is not always possible since when we go further into the year and have final exams, it's going to be harder for all of us to work on things and we might slack off sometimes so we have already we already trying to work on ways we can contact each other and setting up times we can talk to each other for that.<br><br>
	(Software) Development Engineer: These engineers develop products to make them fit the best needs of the customers. They are constantly working to make their software better and more functional.This role should not be that much of a problem for me since I now know how to code and develop different parts of the website. The challenges I think I will face while trying to be a software development engineer are making functional links in inappropriate places on the website so it's clearly visible and Interactive and making a consistent amount of formatting and not having some words without spaces. I intend to overcome this by using the CSS file so everything is consistent throughout the website.
	<br><br>
	QA Engineer: These engineers create tests to test a program and debug the errors in it. These guys are like the beta testers of games except they test the software before it goes out for public use.This role might be a little difficult for me since I have not made a program that will test another program but I think in the context of this project, a QA engineering role would mean testing every link and making sure the website is functioning properly so I plan to go in all individual links and make sure that they work properly and that they take the users to their intented location.
	<br><br>
	Project Manager: This is the person who is like the leader of the team. This person is in charge of managing the whole project and making sure the team is heading in the right direction and finishing the project on time while ensuring that all the criteria of the project are met.The project manager role for me I think would be the best suitable because I am someone who likes to lead a team and I think I do a really good job of making sure that everyone in the team is connecting properly and is working on the task. I plan to make a matrix table and a Gantt chart to make sure the team is using the right tools to make the website for many therapy sessions and is on track to finish by the end of the  Semester.
	<br><br>
	Product Manager: This person takes the criticism and suggestions of the users of a product and tries to upgrade the software according to the user's needs. Product managers are the ones that turn the vision of users into reality.I personally don't think that the product manager role is the best role for me but at the same time, I would not mind having it if my teammates why do something else. The problem I expect to encounter with this role is having enough people that will visit our website and play the session so that we get in feedback to know what we need to improve on but I am thinking of overcoming this by going up to everyone in the class and asking them to play the game and other people from outside the class so that we can take their opinion and see patterns unimprovable me to improve on.
	<br><br>
	Release Engineer: These engineers are like a sub-branch of software engineers in that they deal with the accumulation and delivery of source codes into softwares and programs.This role is probably the least suitable role for me because I am not the best member to have a database for all the source codes of the software and the website. I expect to encounter a lot of challenges in this role and one of them is losing some of the source codes by accident. I wouldn't end to fix this by having a slip friend add Branch to keep all the source codes for the project so it is safe and secure.
