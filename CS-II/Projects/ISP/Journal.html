	Technical challenges :Technical challenges: The first challenge since we started the project in 2022 was that our team was trying to come up with an idea that would be beneficial to use as a project both for the class and for ourselves. We were trying to basically go by the term “two birds in one storm” and make something that will give us a good grade and also serve as a great achievement to show to job recruiters. So in order to tackle this we decided to do a Project which lets people get some mental health support through a mini-therapy session. This not only meets all the requirements for our project for the class but also is a good resource to use because of all that we have gone through since 2020 with the covid and everything that has happened since then.

	Scheduling Challenges: So far our first challenge was to create a schedule and how we will use our time to make paste M possession and finish the project in time. Since we learned that our project has to be done by the end of this year we took note of how many months we have and started dividing each section up into 50 pieces. For now, we have decided that we wheel work to build a site that is completely functional and has no problems navigating. In order to complete this challenge we have watched videos on YouTube and have read some articles online on how to make a page that is precisely navigable add has all the features for a popular-looking page or page that people will click on. We have already begun working on it text you are confident that we will be able to finish in time according to our deadlines.

	Interpersonal challenges: So far to be honest Sense we just started the project about a month ago and all of us have a basic background in computer science and have taken columns by one together in the same school, we all pretty much basically have the same bag on Amazon cam site so there haven't been too many challenges where one person we're not understanding something so far. we also didn't have any communication errors so far so we look forward to keeping this up but this is not always possible since when we go further into the year and have final exams, it's going to be harder for all of us to work on things and we might slack off sometimes so we have already we already trying to work on ways we can contact each other and setting up times we can talk to each other for that.
