    <h2>4-April-2023</h2>
    <h3>
      Technical Challenges: This week we had some problems with formatting because of some errors we got while we tried to push stuff. we found out that we had some merging problems since we were all working on the same file and it was not on sync properly, so we found a solution by doing get rebase.<h3>

      Scheduling Challenges: So far we didn't have any scheduling challenges and all of us have been working we message each other if we need any help I'll set up a school and obviously we use also GitHub to commit issues so that each of us knows what we have to do and what the other members expecting of us to do.<h3>

      Interpersonal Challenges: As a friend, I don't have anything bad to say about my teammates. they have been doing what they're supposed to do and we are doing what we can to make sure that we have a minimum viable product to buy the end of the year so you can do our presentation.<h3>

  <h3>  Technical Challenges: I am having difficulties working with the gihunio website since it takes too long to reload so I cannot see the progress right away but am trying my best to work with it and make sure I get something done each week. I am pretty sure the other team members also feel the same way about this and we should have just went with the codermerlin  website because it si more responsive.<br><br>
																																																			 

    Scheduling Challenges: Our biggest challenge right now is that we feel like we are getting behind our ISP work because of the tests we are taking specially prepping for the AP classes since we will have to take them soon so our ISP work flow is getting slowed down but we atre tying our best to make sure we are on track.<br><br>



    Interpersonal Challenges: As of now our group is not working to the best of it’s abilities but I do not want o blame anyone since I am also struggling to keep the progress going. We are doing what we can and its getting harder since for me personally because of graduation and college work since I am a senior.<br><br>

      Technical Challenges: This week we have worked on the scrolling of the page to make sure that the mouse works. and now we're making sure that behind each question there is a yes or no button which can be used by the user to show how they feel about certain topics.<br><br>



      Scheduling Challenges: So far there have not been many problems as of now. we are trying our best to work and finish the project by the due deadline. we are using Discord and iPhone messages to the best of our ability to talk to each other.<br><br>



      Interpersonal challenges: As far as of now my teammates have been working hard and I have no problems working with them. Everyone on this team has been doing great and I hope we can keep going and finish this project in time.<br><br></h3>

    <h3>
      I am mostly responsible for the layout of the website as a Product manager  so I am going to list out what I have told my team to do for the project so far and how it should be done:<br>



     1. I told them to have different questions( like the one I made up in the picture) and under those have checkboxes for yes or no.<br>

      2.After the user is done doing that they will get specific questions based on their patterns of selection.<br>

      3.The user will then know different things about different illnesses and how they can cope with them on a different page.<br>

      4.In the end, there should be a website stating a possible list of doctors in the area that treat certain conditions depending on the answers the user gets.<br>



      I am now waiting on my team members to build some of the pages so that I can also test out the bugs as a Q/A engineer.

      Technical Challenges: This week our challenges have still been pretty much the same. on top of that we are trying to make it now so we can go back and forth on our website so that it's easily accessible. but other team members have made a button that's clickable but they haven't made it for every page so we're working on that right now currently.<br><br>

      Scheduling Challenges: So far there have not been that many scheduling challenges we have talked everything out in class and now we're just doing what we're supposed to do individually according to our given tasks and we keep it informed through issues.<br><br>

      Interpersonal challenges:  As of now I don't have any issues with my teammates they're working really hard and we're doing our best to make the website run and coding as much as we can so that the website is fun to use.<br><br></h3>
    <h2>10-Mar-2023</h2>
    <h3> Technical Challenges: So far I only challenge has been getting enough information so that we can make the site helpful. I have been working together on information like different questions so I can ask the user so that they can be helped by our project. the other team members are working on making the website run.<br><br>



      Scheduling Challenges: We have been working together and so far our biggest challenge is not being able to reach each other when we need to.  when someone calls someone sometimes we can't find each other on Discord and can't send each other messages because of that. I also think that our communication could be better.<br><br>



      Interpersonal challenges: So far I still have no complaints. Everyone on this team has been doing great and I hope we can keep going and finish this project in time.<br><br> </h3>

      Technical challenges: So far we had a few technical challenges like having some problems establishing our page because of GitHub issues. we intend to fix this as a team by talking to Mr. Ben after the break is over and asking him for advice on how to publish the website for everyone else to see.<br><br>
      Scheduling Challenges: So far we haven't had any scheduling issues. we were thinking about working on this project on spring break but in the end, made the decision that we want to work on this after the weekend since we are not supposed to be studying during spring break anyways.<br><br>


      Interpersonal challenges: So far none of my team members have been a hassle to work with and all of them have shown tremendous working capability and have worked hard with me in order to build this project I don't have any bad things to say about them.<br><br>
      
    <h2>17-Feb-2023</h2>
    <h3>
      Technical challenges: This week we created a website that is running and we started to put questions in there and make the animations so the user can start getting their questions answered. we also have started to research about different things that we can put on our website to help the user.<br><br>
      Scheduling challenges So far our problem has been communication since we haven't been able to find each other outside of school hours because of school exams and stuff but we are still trying our best and finding time out of our busy schedules to make the website and have it done by the end of the year.<br><br>
      Interpersonal challenges: So far I have nothing but positive words for my teammates and they're working really hard just like I am to keep this project moving we believe that we will be able to finish our project by the end of April.<br><br>
      
    <h2>10-Feb-2023</h2>
    <h3>Technical challenges: This week we have to do a presentation by the end of next week so we plan to upgrade our presentation and put more Concepts and how we will go through our project. we intend to embed videos I'll buy the question so that the user can understand the problems that they're facing.<br><br>
      
      Scheduling challenges: The schedule changes we had is that talking through the messages and issuing issues on GitHub doesn't really help make the other person understand what the other person is truly meaning so what we figured is that we get our disco call and actually talk to each other because that is the best way to figure out issues and we have better communication in general.<br><br>
      Interpersonal challenges: So far I don't have any problems with my team members and they're doing what they're supposed to do. we are working together to build our project and no team member is lacking in their hard work.<br><br>
      
    
    <h2>03-Feb-2023</h2>
    <h3>
      Technical challenges: This week we brainstormed about potential questions for ISP and what they would look like and we also started working on our eyes presentation which we have to present someday in the future. we haven't really been able to do too much because of winter and the ice and so our school is shut down we intend to start working again after the school opens.<br><br>


      Scheduling challenges So far we didn't have any scheduling challenges since everyone in the group is really responsive and we have a group chat where we're just talking and giving each other ideas and what to do and how to do something. we are also using GitHub to commit issues so that the other team member can see them and finish them in time so we are going quickly so we can finish our project by the time we need to.<br><br>


      Interpersonal challenges So far no one in the group is doing bad, everyone is doing good and I do not have any bad things to say about anyone. everyone is doing what they're supposed to do and finishing tasks on time and I believe that we can finish this project in time<br><br>

    <h3>
      Technical Challenges: This week we had to do some research on various mental illnesses and we were having some problems because a lot of them we were unaware of and we had some trouble finding their examples and in-depth explanations that we can showcase to the people. We tried to fix that by doing intense research on some of them and trying to put all of the information in a Google doc and cut off the excess information.<br><br>


      Scheduling Challenges: So far as of this week we did not have any scheduling challenges since our whole team is working based on the chart we made and we all pretty much know what we have to do so we basically make sure we get it done. If we cannot do it then we call each other and we'll set up a time for that after school and we just help each other out on things we do not know how to do. An example is that we already had to ask each other through messages to send each other pictures of different things as of now.<br><br>


   Interpersonal Challenges:  So far no one has not done their work and I am pretty satisfied with my whole team both of my teammates are working phenomenally and they're doing exactly what they're supposed to do following the guidelines and what I say as the product manager.
      
    
    <h2>20-Jan-2023</h2>
    <h3> Technical Challenges: This week we talked about how long our project can be and how much information we want to go over and gather to make sure that everyone who uses our session is helped in some way shape or form. Our primary purpose is to make people happier and more comfortable within themselves and their lives.<br><br>


      Schduling Challenges: This week we talked about the button functionalities of our site and how we would implement those in the website and who will mainly work on it and we decided that we would split it between two group members.<br><br>


     Interpersonal Challenges: So far no group members have been bad and everyone has contributed pretty nicely and I have no complaints so far into our project.Everything has pretty much done the parts thay they were assigned and I am satisfied with everyones effort<br><br>
      
    <h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>
    <h3>
      Technical Challenges: For this week the technical challenges we faced were committing things that were in the repository to Git Hub. Because of this, we were having trouble uploading our readme.md file in the GitHub repository. We later fixed this by going to the shell and first making a repository for our project and then to the repository making a readme file and pushing it to github through git push. We also had problems like not being able to work on the same code but we fixed those issues by doing get clone so that all of us can work on the same code and edit the way we want to .<br><br>

     Scheduling Challenges:  For this week our main scheduling challenge was coming together and making a good website that can run. We first cloned all of our repositories so we could work on the same code and then created the basic functionality of the website since our teacher said that we would rather first make the website so it is functional and then add the advanced stuff to it.<br><br>

     Interpersonal Challenges: We were having some challenges because one of our team member was not able to get the GitHub repository for our project since he had a miscommunication with the teacher and he could not get the link to accept the invite from the teacher. Even though there was a problem he eventually fixed it by telling the teacher about it and later getting the invitation link.<br><br>

	Technical challenges :Technical challenges: The first challenge since we started the project in 2022 was that our team was trying to come up with an idea that would be beneficial to use as a project both for the class and for ourselves. We were trying to basically go by the term “two birds in one storm” and make something that will give us a good grade and also serve as a great achievement to show to job recruiters. So in order to tackle this we decided to do a Project which lets people get some mental health support through a mini-therapy session. This not only meets all the requirements for our project for the class but also is a good resource to use because of all that we have gone through since 2020 with the covid and everything that has happened since then.
	<br>
	<br>
	Scheduling Challenges: So far our first challenge was to create a schedule and how we will use our time to make paste M possession and finish the project in time. Since we learned that our project has to be done by the end of this year we took note of how many months we have and started dividing each section up into 50 pieces. For now, we have decided that we wheel work to build a site that is completely functional and has no problems navigating. In order to complete this challenge we have watched videos on YouTube and have read some articles online on how to make a page that is precisely navigable add has all the features for a popular-looking page or page that people will click on. We have already begun working on it text you are confident that we will be able to finish in time according to our deadlines.
	<br>
	<br>
	Interpersonal challenges: So far to be honest Sense we just started the project about a month ago and all of us have a basic background in computer science and have taken columns by one together in the same school, we all pretty much basically have the same bag on Amazon cam site so there haven't been too many challenges where one person we're not understanding something so far. we also didn't have any communication errors so far so we look forward to keeping this up but this is not always possible since when we go further into the year and have final exams, it's going to be harder for all of us to work on things and we might slack off sometimes so we have already we already trying to work on ways we can contact each other and setting up times we can talk to each other for that.<br><br>
	(Software) Development Engineer: These engineers develop products to make them fit the best needs of the customers. They are constantly working to make their software better and more functional.This role should not be that much of a problem for me since I now know how to code and develop different parts of the website. The challenges I think I will face while trying to be a software development engineer are making functional links in inappropriate places on the website so it's clearly visible and Interactive and making a consistent amount of formatting and not having some words without spaces. I intend to overcome this by using the CSS file so everything is consistent throughout the website.
	<br><br>
	QA Engineer: These engineers create tests to test a program and debug the errors in it. These guys are like the beta testers of games except they test the software before it goes out for public use.This role might be a little difficult for me since I have not made a program that will test another program but I think in the context of this project, a QA engineering role would mean testing every link and making sure the website is functioning properly so I plan to go in all individual links and make sure that they work properly and that they take the users to their intented location.
	<br><br>
	Project Manager: This is the person who is like the leader of the team. This person is in charge of managing the whole project and making sure the team is heading in the right direction and finishing the project on time while ensuring that all the criteria of the project are met.The project manager role for me I think would be the best suitable because I am someone who likes to lead a team and I think I do a really good job of making sure that everyone in the team is connecting properly and is working on the task. I plan to make a matrix table and a Gantt chart to make sure the team is using the right tools to make the website for many therapy sessions and is on track to finish by the end of the  Semester.
	<br><br>
	Product Manager: This person takes the criticism and suggestions of the users of a product and tries to upgrade the software according to the user's needs. Product managers are the ones that turn the vision of users into reality.I personally don't think that the product manager role is the best role for me but at the same time, I would not mind having it if my teammates why do something else. The problem I expect to encounter with this role is having enough people that will visit our website and play the session so that we get in feedback to know what we need to improve on but I am thinking of overcoming this by going up to everyone in the class and asking them to play the game and other people from outside the class so that we can take their opinion and see patterns unimprovable me to improve on.
	<br><br>
	Release Engineer: These engineers are like a sub-branch of software engineers in that they deal with the accumulation and delivery of source codes into softwares and programs.This role is probably the least suitable role for me because I am not the best member to have a database for all the source codes of the software and the website. I expect to encounter a lot of challenges in this role and one of them is losing some of the source codes by accident. I wouldn't end to fix this by having a slip friend add Branch to keep all the source codes for the project so it is safe and secure.
